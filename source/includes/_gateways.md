# Payment Gateways

The `paymentGateways` object in ODPS defines how **transactions are handled** when pricing plans require financial exchanges—whether from humans or AI agents. It allows you to describe and configure multiple named gateway setups (e.g., `default`, `Agent`, `PremiumStripe`) that can be **referenced from pricing plans**.

Each gateway definition provides a structured way to:

- Describe the payment system (e.g., Stripe, Axio, Custom)
- Point to relevant documentation (`reference`)
- Include executable or declarative configuration under `spec`

This component enables flexible monetization strategies, including differentiated billing models for human users vs. machine users, and support for both traditional and agent-native payment protocols.

**Referencing Payment Gateways:**
Named gateway definitions (e.g., `default`, `Agent`) can be **reused across pricing plans** using `$ref`. This ensures consistent payment logic, minimizes duplication, and allows you to tie multiple plans to a single gateway configuration.

**Benefits of Referencing:**

- **Centralization**: Maintain payment logic in one place and link to it from many pricing plans.
- **Consistency**: Ensure all monetized components use the same gateway logic, version, and authentication flow.
- **Flexibility**: Easily create alternative gateways for specific user segments (e.g., AI agents vs. humans).
- **Transparency**: Documented specs help consumers understand how billing works—and let machines integrate autonomously.


**The Role of `default`:**
Whenever the `paymentGateways` object is used, a gateway named `default` is **expected and required**. It serves as the **primary or fallback payment method** and enables compatibility even in simpler configurations that only need one payment integration.

Use the `default` gateway when:

- You want to offer a single, unified payment method (e.g., Stripe for API consumption)
- You’re not using tiered monetization or segmentation
- You want to future-proof your YAML to support pricing plan evolution

Other named gateways (e.g., `Agent`, `premiumStripe`) can be added freely as needed.

> Example of Payment Gateways object usage:

```yml

paymentGateways:
  default:
    description:
      en: API consumption payment gateway for humans
    type: Stripe
    version: 1
    reference: 'https://docs.stripe.com/'
    spec: |
      // Replace this with your actual implementation or link
      stripe.createCheckoutSession({
        amount: 100, // in cents
        currency: 'usd',
        success_url: 'https://your-platform.com/success',
        cancel_url: 'https://your-platform.com/cancel'
      });

  Agent:
    description:
      en: Payment gateway for AI agents
    type: Axio
    version: 1
    reference: 'https://www.x402.org/'
    spec: |
      paymentMiddleware("0xYourAddress", {"/your-endpoint": "$0.01"});

| **type** | string | Stripe, Axio, Checkout, Custom | Defines the payment system or protocol used. Use predefined values. `Custom` allows custom or internal solutions. |
| **version** | string | Free-form version label | Indicates the version of the payment gateway specification, SDK, or integration logic. |
| **reference** | URL | Valid URL | Points to documentation or developer reference for the payment gateway system. |
| **spec** | string / YAML / URL | - | Contains the executable or declarative logic for the payment gateway integration. Can be inline YAML, stringified logic, or link to external file. |
