# Data Product Strategy

The `productStrategy` object captures the business intent behind a data product and links it to a **single higher-level business KPI** it is primarily accountable for. It defines the objectives, the primary KPI at the business level, and the **product-level KPIs** that measure its direct contribution.

Optionally, it can also include **related KPIs** — secondary or cross-unit measures that:

1. **Capture additional value** — show extra benefits beyond the main KPI, useful for demonstrating broader impact.
2. **Track side effects** — monitor unintended positive or negative impacts on other KPIs.
3. **Highlight cross-department value** — reveal benefits for other business units, strengthening prioritization and funding cases.

Beyond KPIs, `productStrategy` can include:

- **objectives** — natural-language statements describing the business outcomes the product supports.
- **strategicAlignment** — references to corporate initiatives, programs, or policy documents that the product contributes to (e.g., Smart City Vision 2030).

By embedding both primary and related KPI connections directly into the product specification, `productStrategy` ensures that data products remain technically sound, strategically aligned, and transparent in how they deliver value.

| Element | Type | Options | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **productStrategy** | object | – | Top‑level block that connects the data product to business goals and KPIs. |
| **objectives** | array of objects | language‑tagged strings | Business objectives the product supports, written in natural language. |
| **contributesToKPI** | object | required | **Single higher‑level business KPI** (from SMART objectives) that this product is accountable for. |
| **id** | string | optional | Identifier of the business KPI (use shared IDs for roll‑ups). |
| **name** | string | required | KPI name. |
| **status** | string | One of: Planned, Active, At Risk, Achieved, Partially Achieved, Cancelled, Expired | Indicates the status of the strategy object. Consider this similar to data product lifecycle status. |
| **description** | string | optional | Human‑readable description. |
| **unit** | string | e.g., `percentage`, `minutes`, `s` | Unit of measurement. |
| **target** | number/string | – | Target value for the KPI. |
| **direction** | enum | `increase`, `decrease`, `at_least`, `at_most`, `equals` | Desired direction of movement. |
| **timeframe** | string | optional | When the target should be met. |
| **frequency** | string | Measurement cadence (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly). |
| **owner** | string | Responsible role/team (optional). |
| **calculation** | string | Human‑readable formula (optional). |
| **productKPIs** | array | optional | KPIs measured **at product level** that influence `contributesToKPI`. Useful for contribution analysis and governance checks. |
| **relatedKPIs** | array | optional | Secondary/cross‑unit KPIs to monitor side‑effects and additional value (informational; not for prioritization). |
| **strategicAlignment** | array | language‑tagged strings | Strategic initiatives, policies, or visions the product aligns with. |


### Governance‑by‑Design checks (Minimum Lovable Gates)

- **Required:** `contributesToKPI.name` present.  
- **Recommended:** ≥1 `productKPIs` with `unit`, `target`, and `calculation`.  
- **Optional:** `relatedKPIs` for secondary/side effects.  
- **Traceability:** use shared KPI `id`s to enable cross‑product roll‑ups against the same business KPI.
