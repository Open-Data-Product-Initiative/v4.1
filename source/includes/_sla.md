# Data SLA

Data Service Level Agreement (SLA) **Object** contains attributes which define the desired and promised quality of the data product. 

**SLA can be defined with 11 standardized dimentions:**

1. latency (minimal amount of time before getting any response.) 
1. uptime (Uptime is a measure of system reliability, expressed as the percentage of time a machine, typically a computer, has been working and available. See more https://uptime.is/.) 
1. responseTime (amount of time to process external request.) 
1. errorRate (Maximum tolerated errors in data, percentage.) 
1. endOfSupport (The date at which your product will not have support anymore.) 
1. endOfLife (The date at which your product will not be available anymore. No support, no access.) 
1. updateFrequency (how often data is updates.) 
1. timeToDetect (How fast can you detect a problem?) 
1. timeToNotify (Once you see a problem, how much time do you need to notify your users?) 
1. timeToRepair (How long do you need to fix the issue once it is detected?) 
1. emailResponseTime (How long do you need to respond to email support requests?) 

Each dimension has objective value, a unit and then monitoring "as code" to verify objective. In some cases monitoring is 
not feasable or possible to arrange for various reasons. Type attribute indicates which monitoring system is used. Reference attribute contains url for reference documentation regarding the monitoring spec. Spec contains the actucal "as code" part which can be executed in selected monitoring system as is. 

Also basic email and phone support information can be expressed inside the SLA component. **Note!** The "as code" part of the component is the initial step towards embracing Everything as Code paradigm, but is still experimental. 


No mandatory attributes at the moment. Optional attributes are listed in own table and an example is given in the right column. 

## Optional attributes and elements

> Example of SLA component usage:

```yml

SLA:
  - dimension: latency
    displaytitle:
      - en: Latency
    objective: 100
    unit: milliseconds
    monitoring:
      type: prometheus
      reference: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/ 
      spec:  
        myTimer.observeDuration();

  - dimension: uptime
    displaytitle:
      - en: Uptime
    objective: 99
    unit: percent
    
  - dimension: responseTime
    objective: 200
    unit: milliseconds
    monitoring:
      type: prometheus
      reference: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/ 
      spec:  
       rate(http_server_requests_seconds_sum[$__rate_interval]) / rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count[$__rate_interval])

  - dimension: errorRate
    objective: 0.1
    unit: percent
  
  - dimension: endOfSupport
    objective: 01/01/2025 # dd/mm/yyyy
    unit: date

  - dimension: endOfLife
    objective: 01/03/2025 # dd/mm/yyyy
    unit: date

  - dimension: updateFrequency
    objective: 7
    unit: days

  - dimension: timeToDetect
    objective: 60
    unit: minutes

  - dimension: timeToNotify
    objective: 120
    unit: minutes

  - dimension: timeToRepair
    objective: 24
    unit: hours

  - dimension: emailResponseTime
    objective: 12
    unit: hours

| <div style="width:150px">Element name</div>   | Type  | Options  | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SLA** | element | - | Binds the SLA related elements and attributes together |
| **dimension** | attribute | string, one of: *latency, uptime, responseTime, errorRate, endOfSupport, endOfLife, updateFrequency, timeToDetect, timeToNotify, timeToRepair, emailResponseTime* | Defines the SLA dimension.   |
| **unit** | attribute  | Options for *unit* are: milliseconds, seconds, minutes, days, weeks, months, years, never, date, null. <br/><br/>  | Name of the quality attribute indicating the timely interval. If date is given, format is dd/mm/yyyy |
| **monitoring** | element | - | Contains the monitoring (computational "as code") structure to validate target state for the selected SLA dimension. |
| **displayTitle** | array | - | Dimension title to be shown is various UIs. Keep it short and sweet. |
| **en** | attribute | [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) defined 2-letter codes | This element binds together other product attributes and expresses the langugage used. In the example this is "en", which indicates that product details are in English. If you would like to use French details, then name the element "fr". The naming of this element follows options (language codes) listed in [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) standard. <br/><br/> You can have product details in multiple languages simply by adding similar sets like the example - just change the binding element name to matching language code. <br/><br/> The pattern to implement multilanguage support for data products was adopted from de facto UI translation practices. The attributes inside this element are commonly rendered in the UI for the consumer and providing a simple way to implement that was the driving reasoning. See for example  [JSON - Multi Language](https://simplelocalize.io/docs/file-formats/multi-language-json/) |
| **type** | attribute | string | monitoring system name name such as Prometheus. The systems enable as code approach to monitor SLA. |
| **spec** | element | - | contains the as code part for monitoring. Content is intended to be in a form that can be injected as is to defined monitoring system. |
| **reference** | URL | Valid URL | Provide URL for the reference documentation |
| **support** | element | - | Support element describes how the customer can reach for help in case of difficulties in usage, billing, or otherwise. |
| **phoneNumber** | string | valid phone number | The support phone number. Use [E.164](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en)  |
| **phoneServiceHours** | string | - | Describes the service hours company provides. Contains information often in week level eg Mon-Fri at 8am - 4pm. |
| **email** | string | valid email address | Email information for support requests. Use [RFC2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822) |
| **emailServiceHours** | string | - | Describes the email service hours company provides. Contains information often in week level eg Mon-Fri at 8am - 4pm. |
| **documentationURL** | URL | Valid URL | URL to documentation |
